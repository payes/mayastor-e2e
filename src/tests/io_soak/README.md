# IO Soak test
JIRA: MQ-25
## Abstract
Runs fio with varying duty cycles concurrently on a number of volumes for an extended duration.

## Parameters
* `e2e_io_soak_load_factor` : Number of volumes per Mayastor node, type integer
* `e2e_io_soak_replicas`    : Number of replicas for each volume, type integer
* `e2e_io_soak_duration`    : Duration of fio runs, type string 
* `e2e_io_soak_protocols`   : Share protocols to run tests with, comma separated list

`e2e_io_soak_duration` is parsed using `golangs` library function `time.ParseDuration`.
So `e2e_io_soak_duration` string is a sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m".
Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". 

## Notes:
To facilitate creation of a largish number of test pods in a reasonable amount of time,
all test pods (excluding the disruptor pods) run fio with a configurable delay,
this is an attempt to makes the test setup more robust.
The delay means CPU utilization on the cluster nodes for an initial period is low
and should make it possible to create pods at a reasonable rate.
As the number of volumes created increases, this period should be increased,
otherwise timeouts for pods being ready will trigger and the test will fail.

All fio runs including the disruptor pods run fio with verification on,
though the disruptor fio run is not checked.

The disruptor pods are identical to test pods execpt that they been configured
to raise a SIGSEGV after a configurable delay.
